  <title><classname>Annotation</classname>: Maintaining and
  Constraining Biodata</title>

  <abstract id="bd-annotation-abstract">
    <para>This chapter examines the BioJava
    <classname>Annotation</classname> API which provides structured
    storage for complex biological data. The Java API referred to in
    this chapter is located in the package
    <classname>org.biojava.bio</classname>. However, as so many
    classes implement the <classname>Annotatable</classname>
    interface, it is applicable throughout. For a complete overview of
    the APIs provided by these packages, please consult the <ulink
    url="api/index.html">JavaDoc documentation</ulink>.</para>

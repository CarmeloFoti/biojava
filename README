Welcome to BioJava.

BioJava is an open-source initiative with the aim of providing the
biological community with objects for representing and manipulating
biological information. We hope that it becomes the one-stop solution for
every-day biological programming.

This distribution contains the biojava classes and resources, along with
scripts for building the .class files and the documentation tree. The CVS
directories are arranged as follows:

biojava-live
 |
 |- src : java source files and package documentation
 |
 |- resources : resource files - images, xml documents
 |
 |- build : scripts for managing your copy of the repository

In addition, the scripts will generate the non-cvs directories docs and
class, which will contain the javadoc documentation and the class files.

The XML portions of this source tree rely on XML.jar, which can be
downloaded from Sun at:

http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/products/xml

To build the project, change to biojava-live and type:

> javac build/Builder.java
> java build.Builder all
> java build.Builder docs

to build a list of packages type:

> java build.Builder package package1 package2 ... packageN

to check for edits type:

> cvs update
and then for each directory under src with at least one modified file, build
the package.

Contact Matthew Pocock (mrp@sanger.ac.uk) for more details, or mail the
biojava mailing list (biojava-l@biojava.org).

Bindings to ACeDB.
<P>
The interfaces and classes within this package encapsulate ACeDB objects, types,
databases and connections. It also defines AceError and AceException for error
handling. It is loosely modeled on the SQL frame work within java.sql, in that
it relies on drivers to implement a database.

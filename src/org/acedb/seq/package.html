The bridge from AceDB objects to biojava implementations.
<P>
This layer should map the ACeDB interfaces into implementations of the
core BioJava interfaces. In this way, an ACeDB database can be viewed as an
org.bio.seq.SequenceDB, and ACeDB sequence objects can be viewed as
org.bio.seq.Sequence objects with features and annotation.

An implementation of an ACeDB database for use with the ACeDB socket server.
<P>
This implements the minimal number of classes necisary to work as a client to
the experimental socket server. The socket server will be available as part of
the ACeDB distribution. The socket server communicates over a normal socket
connection, rather than over RMI. This makes it possible to implement
light-weight clients which are independant of the ACeDB code-base.

Support Vector Machine classification and regression.
<P>
These classes are experimental. They implement support vector machines
for classification and regression. Support vector machines are
powerfull artificial inteligence engines which utilize kernel
functions to compute dod-products in very high dimensional feature
spaces using time and memory related to the number of training
examples, not the size of the feature space.
<P>
The design philosophy for kernels is as follows. There are basic
kernels that calculate a type-specific dot product. These will
normaly be found by looking for a static final method named Kernel
of type SVMKernel within a class. Then there are permutation
kernels. These include PolynomialKernel and RadialBaseKernel. These
use a primary kernel to calculate the dot product in the natural
space for the objects, and then performs some function on that
which produces a result equivalent to doing the same dot-product in
a very much higher dimensional feature space. As far as possible,
kernels are java beans.

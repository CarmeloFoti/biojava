Data structures and algorithms for processing sequences.
<P>
This package deals with suffix trees, weight matricies and dynamic programming.
It uses the same notions of sequences and alphabets as org.biojava.bio.seq, and
extends them to encorporate states, state sequences, alignments and hidden
markov models.
<P>
HMMs are defined by a finite set of states and a finite set of transitions. The
states are encapsulated as subinterfaces of Residues, so that we can re-use
alphabets and ResidueList to stoor legal states and sequences of states. States
that emit residues must implement EmissionState. They can be thought of as a
probability distribution over an alphabet. Other states may contain entire
HMMs, or be non-emitting states which make the model easier to wire. An HMM
contains an alphabet of states and a set of transitions with scores. They realy
resemble directed weighted graphs with the nodes being the states and the arcs
being the transitions.

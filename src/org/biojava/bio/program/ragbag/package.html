The Ragbag package is a set of classes for setting up a virtual sequence contig
without the need of writing Biojava code.  It's a sort of Ensembl for
Dummies.  It uses ComponentFeatures to effect this.
</p>
<p><b>What would I use it for?</b></p>
Any situation where you need to provide a sequence assembled from other sequences and associated annotations, e.g. a DAS 
server.  Other more sophisticated products exist like Ensembl with more features and superior performance but need a brain 
the size of a planet to set up.  Ragbag is not intended to compete with those packages but to just provide an easier way of 
setting up a minimalistic annotated sequence.
<p><b>How do I use it?</b></p>
<p>
To use Ragbag, you only need to understand two structures.  Every directory represents a sequence.
</p>
<p>
A directory that doesn't have a file named "Map" is assumed to have a single sequence file and (optionally) a directory 
named "Annotation" containing files holding features to be annotated onto that sequence.  The sequence file will be 
instantiated into a SimpleSequence object and all the features present in files in the Annotation directory will be applied 
as features on this SimpleSequence object.
</p>
<p>
If a directory has a "Map" file, then that file contains in an XML format all the mappings of sequences in that 
directory onto the SimpleAssembly object that the directory is associated with.  These sequences can be in sequence files or 
be directories that themselves represent other virtual sequences either of the SimpleSequence or SimpleAssembly types.  Any 
files in the Annotation directory will be applied as features onto the SimpleAssembly directly.
</p>
<p>
A hierarchy of sequences can be constructed by merely constructing a directory tree and editing the Map files.
</p>
<p>
From a software perspective, instantiating a RagbagDirectoryHandler on the root directory will instantiate the whole 
contig in memory.
</p>
<p><b>Current Limitations and Future Plans</b></p>
<p>
Only the GAME format is currently supported.  The Annotations folder feature does not work with the SimpleAssembly 
contigs yet. Planned features include (a) support for EMBL, Genbank and XFF formats, (b) a 
caching scheme to reduce RAM requirements.  When EMBL/Genbank support is introduced, it will be possible to annotate your 
virtual contig by editing the EMBL/Genbank files within the directory structure with Artemis!

<p>
Under active development. Not warranted to work for any particular or even general purpose.  Suited to coders with a death 
wish. <b>VERY EXPERIMENTAL CODE!!!!</b>

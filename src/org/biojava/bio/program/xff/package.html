Event-driven parsing system for the Extensible Feature Format (XFF).
This is currently targetted at the XFF 0.2 proposal.  For more
information, see <a href="http://www.biojava.org/thomasd/XFF/">The
XFF proposal page</a>.

<p>
XFF is an experimental format, and both the format and the APIs
in this package may change in the future.

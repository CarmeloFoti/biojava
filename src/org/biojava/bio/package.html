The core classes that will be used throughout the bio packages.
<P>
The classes BioException and BioError form the basis of error-handeling within
the core classes. They both can optionaly wrap a source Throwable, and carry a
message. The stack-trace printed should contain a single merged stack-trace,
together with all messages inserted in the propper places. These exceptions
can be nested to any depth, providing an organic and natural way to trace errors
and bugs.
<P>
The Annotation classes are used throughout the org.biojava.bio interface
hierachy to indicate that there is un-typed information that may optionaly be
associated with an object. The Annotation object takes the form of a paranoid
Map, and Annotatable flags an object as having an associated Annotation object.

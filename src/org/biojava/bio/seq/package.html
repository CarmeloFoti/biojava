Classes and Interfaces for defining sequences.
<P>
This package contains the core classes and interfaces for defining
sequences and features. All definitions are interfaces. Where ever
possible, at least one pure java implementation of the interface is
supplied.
<P>
Computationaly, the most natural way to represent a string is as a
list of tokens from some alphabet. This representation gives us
great freedom in defining the tokens within an alphabet, without
restricting us to a single set of tokens. It also decouples the
representation of the string from the alphabet it is over. Since
every appearance of a given token with all sequences is
indistinguishable, we can reuse these objects and reference them
multiple times using the flyweight design pattern.
<P>
The model we use is as follows:
<br>
Residue - A token
<br>
Alphabet - A set of tokens
<br>
ResidueList - A string over an alphabet of tokens
<p>
Throughout the seq package, Annotation and Annotatable are used
to stoor and retrieve annotations. These apply to the entire
Annotatable object, and are a loose key-value map. They are for
stooring data that does not easily fit the object model.
<p>
Once we have got these abstract definitions in place, we can move
onto representing biologicaly useful sequences. These are defined
by the Sequence interface. It inherits the ResidueList interface
for stooring the sequence. It also implements Annotatable which
allows annotation to be attached to the entire sequence. Lastly,
it implements FeatureHolder so that it can contain features.
<P>
Features are regions of a sequence which have location-specific
annotation or meaning. The Location interface is a very fluid
way of defining the region to annotate. Features can contain
sub-features, as they are FeatureHolder implementors. They are
also annotatable. Lastly, they contain a couple of fields aimed
at enhancing GFF interoperability.
<P>
Also within this package are the classes that implement these
interfaces. They are usualy preceeded with 'Simple' to indicate
that they are vanilla, pure-java implementations. You should
be able to use these object out-of-the-box.
<P>
The other classes are supporting code, that should realy be
hidden from the casual observer. They are abstract implementations
or objects that are instantiated within 'Simple' objects but
only ever returned to the user by interface. It is worth
looking at them if you are interested in deriving your own
classes from the interfaces, or wish to extend the 'Simple'
implementations.

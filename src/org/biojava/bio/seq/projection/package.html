Code for projecting Feature objects into alternate coordinate systems.

<p>
This package contains the underlying `engine' code for feature
projection.  To use it, you will need to write an implementation
of the <code>ProjectionContext</code> interface to encode the
projection logic you want.  For simple applications (most
linear coordinate transforms) you will normally want to use
the simpler <code>ProjectedFeatureHolder</code>, which uses
this API internally.

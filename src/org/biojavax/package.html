  <p>The Biojava extensions packages, classes that extend the core biojava 
     functionality</p>
  <p>The biojavax packages contain a number of extensions to the core biojava 
     interfaces. These extensions are designed to very closely model the 
     OBDA BioSQL database schema. Several new classes are introduced and their
     relationships are best explained by the BioSQL schema.</p>
   <p>The interfaces of most interest to users will be the <code>BioEntry</code>
      and the <code>RichSequence</code>. The <code>BioEntry</code> holds key
      description information about a biological entity but no actual sequence.
      This allows consistent description of biological records that may or may
      not have sequence. The <code>RichSequence</code> interface is an extension
      of <code>Sequence</code> and <code>BioEntry</code>. Think of it as an old
      fashioned biojava <code>Sequence</code> with more accessors that let you
      get at the information with some funky relationship capabilities thrown in.
      </p>
   <p>Where possible we have made extensive use of interfaces and multiple
      inheritance (via interfaces). Hence, <code>RichSequence</code> can be used
      whenever a <code>Sequence</code> is required. <code>RichAnnotation</code>
      can often be substituted for <code>Annotation</code> etc.
      </p>
   <p>The basic implementations are also designed to work with Hibernate allowing
     easy persitence to a BioSQL db.
